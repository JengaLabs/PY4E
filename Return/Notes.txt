Glossary :

Bug  : Error in program

CPU : Processor that runs code

Compile : translate program from high level language to low level for later execution.

Interactive mode : python interprety that lets you just type code.

Intrepret : excute program in high level language by translating it one line at a time.

Low-level language: a programming language that is designed to be easy for a computer to excute. Machine code

Main memory : stores programs and data. Main memory loses its information when the power is turned off.

Parse : to examine a program and analyze the syntactic strucutre.

Portabilty : a property of a program that can run on more than one kind of computer

Print : pythons debug / write to console

Problem solving : process of formulating a problem / finding a solution.

Program : a set of instructions that a computer follows

Prompt : dispalys message that pauses for the user to input a respsonse

Secondary memory : stroes programs and data and retains its information. Slower than main memory. Disk dirves and usb sticks.

Semantics : rules of a programming langauage

Exercise1 : 1.C 2.Set of instructions for computer to follow. 3.Compiler translates high level code. Intrepreter excutes high level code.

GLOSS { 
Fixed Values are letters and strings that are constants. 

Resered words : identifiers and names reserved for python.

Variable is a named place in memory where a programmer can store data. \

Expressions : In order of precedence, if same row, it's done left to right
() : Parenthesis 
** : Power
* : Multiplication  / : Division   % : remainder/ modulus
+ : addition - : subtraction

concatenate : put together
